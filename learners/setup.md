### Help

If you get stuck at any step, first try to solve the issue yourself or with the
help of an instructor. If needed, you can also download a working version of the
pipeline here:

<a href="data/pipeline.cppipe" download class="btn btn-primary" style="display:inline-block;padding:8px 12px;background:#007bff;color:#fff;border-radius:4px;text-decoration:none;">Download pipeline</a>

Then, import this pipeline in CellProfiler by clicking on
`File` > `Import` > `Pipeline from File`.
