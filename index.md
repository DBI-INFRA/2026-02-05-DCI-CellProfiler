### Introduction
This workshop will teach you how to use CellProfiler for nuclei and cell
segmentation, as well as feature extraction. It is organised by the 
<strong><a href="https://dbi-infra.eu">Danish Bioimaging Infrastructure</a></strong>, 
which is a network that provides services for bioimage analysis, including teaching workshops, setting up workstations and 
providing 1-on-1 support. It includes the <a href="https://www.dbi-infra.eu/iacf-home">
Image Analysis Core Facility</a>, which provides further help, for example by completing entire analysis
projects. For more information, <a href="https://www.dbi-infra.eu/iacf-services">click here</a> to learn
more about the things IACF can help you with.

Together, we will analyse a small image dataset on the impact of a 
chemical compound on cell morphology. We will use CellProfiler to detect cells
and measure their morphology, before exporting our results. Time permitting,
you can then see how to use these results in the bonus episode!
